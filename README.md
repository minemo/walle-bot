#Walle-Bot

---
##What is this ?
This is discord bot with some features for me and my friends.
It mainly focuses on a blockchain-based earn and reward system,
to make the server more fun to use.

---
##What can it do ?
The features of this bot currently include:
+ **DEBUG** show all accounts, and their respective balances
+ **DEBUG** show some Blockchain debug info like blocknumber and latest transaction
+ Claiming an account from a _preexisting_ Ethereum-based Blockchain
+ Checking your account information with chat commands 
+ sending funds from one account to another
+ Earning funds by being in a voice-channel for some time
+ Reporting the earned funds to a seperate, pre-defined channel
+ Redeem funds in a variety of ways such as:
    1. Turn of/on someones Spotify
    2. Skip songs in someones Spotify
    3. Change someones wallpaper to one you define
       
_all these redeems cost a predefined ammount of the currency in the Blockchain and have to be executed
by a locally running webserver, that recieves them via specified URL-parameters_

_The Bot also responds to each request with a message in embedd form like this:_

_Rewards for being online get displayed in another channel_

##What is planned ?
_I constantly get new ideas on what to add to the bot, so don't expect this list to be up to date._

Some planned features are:
+ The ability to create Identicons for the individual addresses, if the account holder wants them
+ More possibilities of redeeming currency for fun actions
+ The ability to customize the channels, the bot sends messages in
+ Some more non-reward oriented commands like
    1. Providing general server information
    2. Converting a message to TTS with different Voices
    3. Eastereggs
+ ...

##Where can I test this ?
